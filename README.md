# Rock-Paper-Scissors GUI Application

This is a Rock-Paper-Scissors GUI application built using PySide6, a Python binding for the Qt application framework. The application allows users to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer, with a score display and theme customization.

## Files and Modules
The application consists of the following files and modules:
- `ui_functions.py`: Contains utility functions for setting up and customizing the GUI.
- `ui_main.py`: Contains the UI definition for the main application window.
- `core.py`: Contains core application logic (not shown in the provided code snippet).
- `settings.json`: Contains application settings in JSON format.
- `main.py`: Initializes the application and sets up the GUI.

## Main Application File (`main.py`)
The main application file, `main.py`, is responsible for initializing the application and setting up the GUI. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Import Modules**: The first line imports the necessary modules: `ui_functions` for GUI utility functions, `ui_main` for the UI definition, and `json` for loading settings from the `settings.json` file.
2. **Load Settings**: The `access_settings` variable is opened, and the `data` variable is loaded with the contents of the `settings.json` file using the `json.load()` function.
3. **Define MainWindow Class**: The `MainWindow` class is defined, which inherits from `QMainWindow`. This class represents the main application window.
4. **Initialize MainWindow**: In the `__init__` method, the `QMainWindow` constructor is called, and the `ui` attribute is set to an instance of `Ui_MainWindow`, which is the UI definition for the main window.
5. **Setup UI**: The `setupUi` method is called to set up the GUI, and the `Setup_GUI` function from `ui_functions` is called to apply settings to the GUI.
6. **Show Window**: The `show` method is called to display the window, and the `SetTheme` function from `ui_functions` is called to set the theme for the application.
7. **Start Application**: In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, the application is initialized by creating a `QApplication` instance and passing the command-line arguments to it. An instance of the `MainWindow` class is created, and the `exec_` method is called to start the application's event loop.

## Game Logic
The core game logic allows the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors and plays against the computer's random choice. The outcome is then displayed, and the score is updated accordingly.
